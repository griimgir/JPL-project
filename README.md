# Mission Control Console Interface

A front-end project that simulates a 1970s inspired interface of a rocket launch. Created by Alberc Ej Salcedo


## [Link to Demo ](https://www.asalcedo.com/)(3 second launch to showcase the simulation)

## Features

- Drop menu that fetcches data about rockets and launchpads through SpaceX-API

-  Simulation includes velocity, altitude, and Fuel Burn (time duration of 120 seconds)
    - Counting up uses an Easing function that allows an effect which slows the count at the end of the counter when it reaches closer to the maximum duration

    - The simulation only runs after the start sequence completes it's count down (demo 3 seconds, and for submitted project 300 seconds or 5 minutes). This is achieved by a simple if else statement. Only when the condition of time >= 0 is true, lift off is achieved.

- Timer for demo is 3 seconds however the project submitted through email has the correct 300 seconds/5 minute criteria that was asked. It is completley customizable as shown below. Modify initialTime to desired launch countdown.

Time, Calendar, and drop down menu are functional and will be able to choose freely, however due to time limitation to respect the 4 hour limit these features are more so decorative for the immersion of the simulation and have no effect on the actual launch. The seletion of rockets and launchpads are not statically hard coded but serve to showcase the project does fetch from the api using GET.
